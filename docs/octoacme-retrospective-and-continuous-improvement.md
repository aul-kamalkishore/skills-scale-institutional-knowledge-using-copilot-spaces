# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Scrum Master facilitates the retrospective and ensures psychological safety
- Include all roles (Developers, PM, PdM, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer) for comprehensive feedback

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Scrum Master tracks completion of action items and reports progress
- DevOps Engineer may implement tooling or automation for process improvements
