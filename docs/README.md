# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides a central entry point for OctoAcme's project management documentation. It includes a high-level summary of our core processes and direct links to each process guide.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme uses an iterative, customer-focused approach with clear ownership and defined roles. Our project management framework emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement to deliver reliable results. Projects follow a structured lifecycle with well-defined phases, each supported by specific processes and artifacts that guide teams from concept to production and beyond.

At the heart of OctoAcme's approach is a balance between agility and predictability. Teams work in iterative cycles with regular checkpoints, quality gates, and stakeholder communication. We prioritize customer value while maintaining technical excellence through established testing, code review, and deployment practices. Risk management and proactive communication are woven throughout the lifecycle to identify and address challenges early.

Our project lifecycle consists of five core phases: **Initiation** establishes the business case, scoping, stakeholder alignment, and success criteria. **Planning** focuses on backlog setup, timeline and milestone mapping, and risk/dependency management. **Execution & Tracking** implements an agile rhythm with board workflow, quality gates (test/lint/acceptance), reporting, and escalation paths. **Release & Deployment** follows a checklist-driven process with pre-release verification and rollback plans. Finally, **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** captures learnings, documents action items, and drives ongoing enhancements.

Clearly defined roles and personas—including Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders—ensure accountability and effective collaboration. Communication strategies and escalation paths support timely decision-making and transparency across all levels of the organization. This comprehensive approach enables OctoAcme teams to deliver reliably while adapting to changing requirements and continuous learning.
